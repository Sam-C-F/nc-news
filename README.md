# Front End Portfolio Website

You can find a live version of the site hosted by Netlify [here](https://front-end-portfolio-project.netlify.app/). The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Sam-C-F/nc-news).

This React app was created using a **RESTful API** that was created as my [back end portfolio project](https://github.com/Sam-C-F/Back-End-Portfolio-Project).

This project is a **front end** news website, in the style of Reddit or Quora, built using **React**. It uses a back end API to create a working prototype.

### Requirements:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[git](https://git-scm.com/)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

To run this from your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam-C-F/nc-news.git
